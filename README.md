# Taskinator
This is my third project for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I build a task-tracker application named Taskinator that utilizes a Kanban Board-style user interface. This application utilizes JavaScript, local storage APIs, and DOM interfaces that allow users to organize their personal to-do list items into organizational columns.
